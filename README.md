# original-hunt-the-wumpus
Original source code of text-based game [Hunt The Wumpus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus) written in [BASIC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) by late  [Gregory Yob](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Yob) (1945â€“2005) in 1973. Claimed to be the earliest survival horror game.
This source code is originally published in [October 1975 issue of Creative Computing](https://archive.org/details/CreativeComputingv01n05SeptemberOctober1975/page/n55/mode/1up) and [The Best of Creative Computing](https://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=250) in 1976, which fortunately can be found online pretty easily, so it didn't take too long to get this source code. 

I uploaded this for the purpose of not only making it easily accessible but also for the sake of preservation in case those links are taken down. You can run this on a BASIC interpreter or, as this code is in public domain, make changes to it as long as you're not doing it in this repository. Do whatever you want with it.

I provided the source code as is, no alterations or changes were ever made. I won't make any changes to it because I wanted to keep this code strictly original as possible. 

Enjoy.
